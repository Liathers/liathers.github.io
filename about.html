	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm a Minecaft and Programming enthusiast, and spend a lot of my time researching and messing around with legacy versions of the game as well as making the odd programming project.</p>
	<a href="https://github.com/Liathers/" target='_blank' onclick="clickSound()"><span class="github-button"></span></a>
	<p>I host a Survival Multiplayer Server called Liath Network for a small group of people to play with few restrictions. The map has been reset twice, and now is on a Long-Term world.</p>
